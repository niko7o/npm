# About
Ironhack prework exercise 1<br> 
Designing a replica of https://www.npmjs.com/ <br>
The site has been coded for desktops 1280x720 & higher <br>
No media queries were inserted for phone/tablets since the learning platform didn't seem to offer/demand them.

# Specifications
We're using a <b>1160px</b> relative grid and positioning our content inside it. <br>
<b>Flexbox</b> was used for the navbar and footer since they are full width on npmjs. <br>
Possible attempt of using css grid properties in the future to fiddle with responsive breakpoints. <br>
Added a javascript function to <b>change the acronym</b> randomly on page load & acronym click just like on https://www.npmjs.com/
